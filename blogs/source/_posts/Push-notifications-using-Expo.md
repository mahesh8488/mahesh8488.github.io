There are several options for push notifications. EXPO's push notification is simple to use. 

1. Register the push token in your app.

Use an endpoint on your servers to save the push token.

```
import { Permissions, Notifications } from 'expo';

const PUSH_ENDPOINT = 'https://your-server.com/users/push-token';

async function registerForPushNotificationsAsync() {
  const { status: existingStatus } = await Permissions.getAsync(
    Permissions.NOTIFICATIONS
  );
  let finalStatus = existingStatus;

  // only ask if permissions have not already been determined, because
  // iOS won't necessarily prompt the user a second time.
  if (existingStatus !== 'granted') {
    // Android remote notification permissions are granted during the app
    // install, so this will only ask on iOS
    const { status } = await Permissions.askAsync(Permissions.NOTIFICATIONS);
    finalStatus = status;
  }

  // Stop here if the user did not grant permissions
  if (finalStatus !== 'granted') {
    return;
  }

  // Get the token that uniquely identifies this device
  let token = await Notifications.getExpoPushTokenAsync();

  // POST the token to your backend server from where you can retrieve it to send push notifications.
  return fetch(PUSH_ENDPOINT, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      Accept: 'application/json',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      token: {
        value: token,
      },
      user: {
        username: 'Brent',
      },
    }),
  });
}
```

2. Send push notification

You probably will end up writing another job or application to make a web request to the push token similar to this:

```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST https://exp.host/--/api/v2/push/send -d '{
  "to": "ExponentPushToken[xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx]",
  "title":"hello",
  "body": "world"
}'
```

EXPO's push notifications are absolutely free of cost and don't require you to sign up for anything.
